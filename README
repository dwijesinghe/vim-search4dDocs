This plugin should enable the user to trigger a search in the 4D documentation 
(http://docs.4d.com) or the Active4D documentation (which you will have to locally download)

Installation Instructions:

1. Save the script to your user directory
2. :source ~/search4dDocs.vim (you can add this to your .vimrc file)
3. Highlight the text you want to search the docs for

---This is all that is needed to enable 4D docs search. For searching the Active4D documentation, continue:

4. For Active4D support - Download a copy of the Active 4D docs to your user directory.
5. Install XPDF (www.foolabs.com/xpdf). Edit your path variables to ensure that it can run in the command-line.
6. :call GenerateActive4dDocs(). Replace the PDF filename in the script if it differs from yours.


Happy Vimming!
